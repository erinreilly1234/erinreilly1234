- 👋 Hi, I’m Erin
- 🐳 I’m interested in remote sensing and coastal oceanography!
    - i'm in the realm of SAR/hyperspectral multi-sensor data fusion and classification algorithms
    - also have dabbled with species distribution modeling with remote sensing inputs
    - fun stuff!
- 🌱 I’m still learning this whole _coding_ thing
- 🏄‍♀️ Fun fact: I make my own surboards! yahooo!
